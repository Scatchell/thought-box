This website is simply a box of thoughts. I hope it is as interesting to others as it is to me to wonder about these things. The thoughts in this box will tend to come in the following flavors:

# Interesting corollaries

...between our every day life and other seemingly unrelated topics.

How Agile Software Development relates to our love life and whether we should get married... How the preferred method of eating a hot dog can reveal critical personality traits about a person... How the skill of a developer can be determined by their method of playing computer games. I think everything is connected in interesting, beautiful, and often hilarious ways.

Someone once told me "if you know the leaf, you can understand the tree" and I think there is a lot of truth to this sentiment. Understanding one small, seemingly insignificant truth, one may potentially reapply that understanding to many areas of their life. Like the movie Good Will Hunting taught us - just examining a persons painting might tell much about their philosophy of life. Looking at just a single leaf with enough depth can give access to truths concerning the trunk of a tree.

# Observations on teams

Almost everyone works in teams to accomplish things - and I've worked with many teams (mostly to build software.) There are many observations and thoughts I've come across concerning these team interactions which I find intriguing. How different personalities work together, what people "really mean" when they say things, and how to communicate and interact in effective ways.

# Thoughts on how to get shit done

Starting is a lot easier than finishing, and I often find teams starting something, and then hedonistically seeking some pleasure in continuing them instead of focusing on how to finish that job. Don't get me wrong, I am also guilty of this. The only advantage I have, if anything, is absolutely hating the fact that I've done it when I realize it's happened.
