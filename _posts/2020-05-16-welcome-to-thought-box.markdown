This website is a box of thoughts. I hope it is as interesting to others as it is to me to wonder about these things. The thoughts in this box will tend to come in the following flavors:

- Interesting corollaries between our every day life and other seemingly unrelated topics.

How Agile Software Development relates to our love life and whether or not we should get married... How the method of eating a hot dog can reveal critical personality traits about a person... How the skill of a developer can be determined by their method of playing computer games. I think everything is connected in interesting and beautiful ways, and we just have to make some effort to connect them and find more universal truths.

Someone once told me "if you know the leaf, you can understand the tree" and I think there is a lot of truth to this sentiment. Understanding one small, seemingly insignificant truth, one may potentially reapply that understanding to many areas of their life. Like the movie Good Will Hunting taught us - just examining a persons painting can tell much about their philosophy of life. Looking at just a single leaf with enough depth can give access to truths at the trunk of a tree.

- Observations from interacting with teams trying to accomplish a goal.

Almost everyone works in teams to accomplish things - and I've worked with many teams to build software. I think there have been many observations and thoughts I've come across concerning these team interactions. How different personalities work together, what people "really mean" when they say things, and how to communicate and interact in effective ways.

- Thoughts on how to get shit done.

Starting is a lot easier than finishing, and I often find teams starting something, and then getting lazy and hedonistically seeking some pleasure instead of finishing the job.
