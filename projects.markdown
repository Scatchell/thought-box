## Unbiased Search

[https://unbiased-search.herokuapp.com/](https://unbiased-search.herokuapp.com/)

Unbiased search is a tool meant to help you to search for things in a fair, unbiased fashion so people can get the information they want, instead of skewed search results.

### What problem it solves

This experiment came from some discussions I had with friends/family members. People often had an explanation for why they believe a "fact" generating a conversation something along the lines of:

> Person 1: Wow, my computers personal assistant is incredibly useful!

> Person 2: Sure, but all of your conversations are being constantly monitored and shared across the internet.

> Person 1: Really? That sounds highly illegal, where did you hear about that?

> Person 2: Yea, it's all over Google! Look: **types into search engine "How the Government is recording all voice traffic from digital assistants and using it against us"**

The internet is a wonderful, beautiful place...but pretty much anything you type into a search engine will yield *some* results. The trick is trying to create a query where you are asking a general question, not trying to receive the answer you already expect.

I realize there are many other pieces to the puzzle here besides simply the way a query is phrased (i.e. a search bubble being created using cookies and user specific history, as just one example) but I thought this was quite common and am worried it has a detrimental impact on our society overall, potentially dividing us further and further away from moderate, informed, realistic, scientific views on controversial statements.

### How it works

[Unbiased search](https://unbiased-search.herokuapp.com/) is a website built to try and use some [natural language processing (NLP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) to gauge whether a search query is written in a biased way...

> How the Government is recording all voice traffic from digital assistants and using it against us

Or an unbiased way...

> Is the Government capable of monitoring voice traffic from digital assistants?

The website takes any query and gives its best guess suggestion on whether it is biased or not, warning the user not to search in the case of a highly biased search.
