# A Short History of Meetings

People have always met.

I'd like to discuss here the different categories of meetings I've noticed over time, but before doing so, I thought it would be good to cover the entire history of human meetings in a few paragraphs. 

What follows are a few important epoch shifting transitions the history of meetings have taken over time which I'd like describe in this historical appraisal.

## Meetings became useful

At first, meetings were useful.

From the first cave-people who grunted the equivalent of "you go that way, I go this way. Then later we come back to this spot." to groups of neanderthals who sat around a fire to decide what food to hunt/pick, meetings were a critical behavior even for prehistoric humans.

Without the ability to discuss and congregate at certain times, prehistoric humans would likely not have been capable of cooperating in any way. These meetings were about some pretty important stuff, some examples derived from extensive research into this subject can be found below:

1. We're about to die of starvation. What do we do?
2. This tiger keeps eating our children. WTF? Does anyone have any spears?
3. Dave is being an ass lately and we can only get enough food for 7 people. He makes 8 so I'm just saying.
4. I have an idea for an invention that will keep us warm and heat food.

etc.

Pretty big stuff. Thus, these first meetings were some of the most important, enabling humans to work together and make plans for the future.

## Meetings became cool

Ancient native tribes, around 1000 BC, made meetings cool. They would sit in a circle smoking weed or opium and I'm sure have some incredible discussions. When they wanted to decide something, they'd have a meaningful discussion about it, and a clearly defined, relatively simple structure would explain how to deal with any conflicts or difference of opinions.

Critically, anyone who didn't agree with the decision would have enough respect for their social group to not be a douche about it, and they'd do their best to follow the instructions the tribe had agreed on even if it was directly opposed to their beliefs.

These meetings would create peace between tribes, plan group migrations, and discuss important, complex sociopolitical issues of the time like "We've only got like 3 barrels left...where do we get more opium?" or "What feathers look the best on our headbands?"

These meetings were not only useful, but they were pretty badass. An epic combination.

## Meetings started to suck

I think meetings started getting messed up around Roman times (~500 BC.) This is when it seems individuals became more concerned with their own personal gain than any potential value from the outcome of a meeting.

It was no longer about how to solve the problem of where to get food, or how to deal with civil disobedience, but now became more about how to make oneself look better in the eyes of the rest of the group.

Suddenly, meetings were simply another vehicle to embellish a speakers reputation, instead of to collaboratively solve problems. Sound familiar?

## Meetings became shit

Lets fast-forward a bit. We've had approximately 2,500 years to further hone our ability to make meetings selfish, useless, and a complete waste of time. After much innovation in the industry of wasting time, we've finally reached the level of expertise in fucking up meetings that only a few millennia of focused blunder could deliver. This brings us to today.

![a picture of an extremely boring meeting](/assets/img/meeting-hell/boring-meeting.jpg){:width="800px"}

Meetings are now hell.

They usually consist of a group of people who don't want to be there, speaking mostly to fill gaps or make personal statements instead of transmit information, and with the only unifying vision being a seemingly universal desire to waste everyone's time.

I'm not saying every meeting is horrible...but it worries me that the legitimately useful ones come so few and far between.

# The List

Now, I'd like to present to you a comprehensive list of the categories representing the types of meetings we can expect to experience today.

## The "Shhhh....the lord speaketh now" meeting

There are some people who just love to talk. Almost nothing can stop them.
When these people come to meetings - you are at risk of a lord speaketh now meeting
Mostly a waste of everyones time because it’s just one person speaking constantly to hear the sound of their own voice
Similar but not exactly the same is...


> The meeting where on self obsessed person gives a monologue (and calls it a meeting)

## The THIS IS SPARTA! meeting

> The meeting where 2-4 people battle for the mantle of "speaking the most"

...leaving no room for anyone else to say anything

What happens when you get 2 or 3 of the big talkers into the same meeting?
The this is sparta meeting happens
Out of a group of 15 3 people battle for the mantle of “filling everyone’s ears with the beautiful sound of their voice”
Different from the lord speaketh now meeting, this one might actually generate some conversation
And has benefit of only silencing 90% of the participants in a meeting instead of 99%
Step in right direction
Now let’s go to a meeting that’s quite the opposite of these….the dreaded….


## The infinite meeting

> The meeting that no one knows how to end, but EVERYONE DESPERATELY WANTS TO

This is the meeting that is scheduled for an hour and after 25 minutes everyone knows there is no content left, but no one feels confident enough to say "goodbye"

## The "It'll be recorded" meeting

> The meeting that everyone agrees should be recorded. (Obviously this recording is never watched.)

## The awkward silence meeting

> The meeting where most people are checking their f****** email instead of participating

Pandemic has increased the percentage of these meetings from 15% to approx 90%
Meeting where you look around at a series of muted black boxes with little white names in them
Speak for 15 minutes about a problem
Then say “So given the situation, what do people think about increasing the budget?”
And then in response, this: --------
Now we can move onto a similarly useless waste of time...

## The "that was a good discussion..." meeting

> The meeting where a group speaks for over an hour about random work related topics accomplishing exactly nothing

This is where you meet to figure out what cloud provider to use and 75 min later you’re still discussing some vulnerability you read about Azure in a blog post last week
At end have no idea what to actually do about the selection
At the end, no one wants to say “well, that was a complete waste of time!” so instead they say “OK well that was a good discussion, think we learned a lot there, let’s schedule another meeting….”
Wasting time twice
Speaking of scheduling another meeting...

## The meeting about the previous meeting that was about the other meeting, meeting

> Sometimes a single meeting produces dozens of spawn that run around consuming all available resources. In this way, meetings are like Covid.

Like a virus - single virus not only kills cell, but makes zombie that creates more to destroy more healthy cells
Similar: from single source meeting - spawn zombie meetings - go off and waste hundreds of hours throughout org.
You have a meeting to decide - people are unprepared  - after an hour nothing happened - waiting on this thing or that person
schedule another
That’s also missing James - equally important - just in a slightly different way
There could be dozens before people finally lose interest and stop wasting time.
People hate these meetings! They don’t want to talk about it anymore
That brings me to the next meeting...

## The great escape meeting

> The recurring meeting everyone constantly tries to avoid

**Interrupt message**
This is the often recurring meeting that no one wants to go to - but all think it’s probably a good idea
The meeting you used to have to literally drag people across the floor rolling in their little office chairs to attend
The one you have to send a dozen messages to people about to force them to come
**interrupt** And then there is the...

## The interrupted meeting

> The meeting where someone is sneak attacked by their children or partner (or Amazon delivery)


Not the most horrible
When kids this is usually adorable
I’ve seen people leave full on presentations to go get new bluetooth headset
leaving everyone awkwardly waiting

## The where is this meeting taking place? meeting

> Hello? Where is everyone? Am I early?

There are dozens of channels, rooms, zoom ids - far too easy to get confused
Often after 10 minutes you leave and join another room, only to find at exact moment everyone has left to join the one you were in
teams vs zoom vs google hangouts
Team member has solved - start up a zoom call that just says

## The let's get drunk meeting

> This one isn't that bad

Makes a meeting a lot more interesting
Thought it deserved a spot on the list
Get people to reveal things they otherwise might not
Next meeting can also be fun....I call it the

## The so, how are your kids? meeting

> The meeting that’s taken up 30% by small talk while waiting for a few members who are late

Expect 10 people and 6 arrive on time, and you start the ‘grace period’
Then what do you do for the first 15 minutes while you wait?
Just chat - shoot the shit
Actually learn a lot about people this way - I quite like these meetings

## The passive aggressive meeting

> The meeting where you think you’ll discuss something useful, but actually someone just wants to complain about not being informed about something

Maybe some political grudge
Maybe some issue with a process
Maybe the caller of the meeting is actually upset they weren’t included in something
Main point: Most of this meeting isn’t about any useful topic, it’s about how someone is pissed off

## The all or nothing meeting

> The meeting that goes on for the fully scheduled 60 minutes when it’s actually complete in less than 15.

A meeting about ‘where are my keys’
About 6 minutes in everyone realizes they’re in your jacket pocket
But there’s 54 minutes left - unbounded potential
How could you waste all that time, where you could be talking?
So they start saying shit like “sure they might be in the jacket but first of all….really...what is a key” - “why do humans live in houses?”
54 minutes later discussing a nietzsche passage
Someone is like “Ohhh we’ve run over we’ll have to schedule another meeting”
