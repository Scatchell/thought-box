# A Short History of Meetings

People have always met.

I'd like to discuss here the different categories of meetings I've noticed over time, but before doing so, I thought it would be good to cover the entire history of human meetings in a few paragraphs. 

What follows are a few important epoch shifting transitions the history of meetings have taken over time which I'd like describe in this historical appraisal.

## Meetings became useful

At first, meetings were useful.

From the first cave-people who grunted the equivalent of "you go that way, I go this way. Then later we come back to this spot." to groups of neanderthals who sat around a fire to decide what food to hunt/pick, meetings were a critical behavior even for prehistoric humans.

Without the ability to discuss and congregate at certain times, prehistoric humans would likely not have been capable of cooperating in any way. These meetings were about some pretty important stuff, some examples derived from extensive research into this subject can be found below:

1. We're about to die of starvation. What do we do?
2. This tiger keeps eating our children. WTF? Does anyone have any spears?
3. Dave is being an ass lately and we can only get enough food for 7 people. He makes 8 so I'm just saying.
4. I have an idea for an invention that will keep us warm and heat food.

etc.

Pretty big stuff. Thus, these first meetings were some of the most important, enabling humans to work together and make plans for the future.

## Meetings became cool

Ancient native tribes, around 1000 BC, made meetings cool. They would sit in a circle smoking weed or opium and I'm sure have some incredible discussions. When they wanted to decide something, they'd have a meaningful discussion about it, and a clearly defined, relatively simple structure would explain how to deal with any conflicts or difference of opinions.

Critically, anyone who didn't agree with the decision would have enough respect for their social group to not be a douche about it, and they'd do their best to follow the instructions the tribe had agreed on even if it was directly opposed to their beliefs.

These meetings would create peace between tribes, plan group migrations, and discuss important, complex sociopolitical issues of the time like "We've only got like 3 barrels left...where do we get more opium?" or "What feathers look the best on our headbands?"

These meetings were not only useful, but they were pretty badass. An epic combination.

## Meetings started to suck

I think meetings started getting messed up around Roman times (~500 BC.) This is when it seems individuals became more concerned with their own personal gain than any potential value from the outcome of a meeting.

It was no longer about how to solve the problem of where to get food, or how to deal with civil disobedience, but now became more about how to make oneself look better in the eyes of the rest of the group.

Suddenly, meetings were simply another vehicle to embellish a speakers reputation, instead of to collaboratively solve problems. Sound familiar?

## Meetings became shit

Lets fast-forward a bit. We've had approximately 2,500 years to further hone our ability to make meetings selfish, useless, and a complete waste of time. After much innovation in the industry of wasting time, we've finally reached the level of expertise in fucking up meetings that only a few millennia of focused blunder could deliver. This brings us to today.

![a picture of an extremely boring meeting](/assets/img/meeting-hell/boring-meeting.jpg){:width="800px"}

Meetings are now hell.

They usually consist of a group of people who don't want to be there, speaking mostly to fill gaps or make personal statements instead of transmit information, and with the only unifying vision being a seemingly universal desire to waste everyone's time.

I'm not saying every meeting is horrible...but it worries me that the legitimately useful ones come so few and far between.

# The List

Now, I'd like to present to you a comprehensive list of the categories representing the types of meetings we can expect to experience today.

## The <span class='meeting-type'>"Shhhh....the lord speaketh now"</span> meeting

> The meeting where on self obsessed person gives a monologue (and calls it a meeting)

There are some people who just love to talk. Almost nothing can stop them.

When these people come to meetings - you are at risk of a "the lord speaketh now" meeting. This is when there is one person speaking, not because they know the most about the subject and are trying to share that knowledge with the rest of the team, but because they relish in constantly hearing the sound of their own voice.

It would be bad enough to be subjected to this alone, but to add insult to injury, it has the additional property of leaving no room for anyone else to say a word. Mere mortals shan't interrupt the lord.


## The <span class='meeting-type'>THIS IS SPARTA!</span> meeting

> The meeting where 2-4 people battle for the mantle of "speaking the most"

The "THIS IS SPARTA!" meeting is similar to the "lord speaketh now" meeting, with some slight modifications.

What happens when you get 2 or 3 of these big talkers into the same meeting? The THIS IS SPARTA! meeting happens

Out of a group of 15, 3 people battle for the mantle of "filling everyone’s ears with the beautiful sound of their voice" the most.

Different from the lord speaketh now meeting, this one might actually generate some conversation, and has benefit of only silencing 90% of the participants in a meeting instead of 99%.

It's a step in right direction.

Now let’s move on to a meeting that’s quite the opposite of these. The dreaded...

## The <span class='meeting-type'>infinite</span> meeting

> The meeting that no one knows how to end, but EVERYONE DESPERATELY WANTS TO

This is the meeting that is scheduled for half an hour, and as it comes to a close, everyone knows they want to leave. They know there is nothing left to speak about. They know it is over. But, no one feels confident enough to say "goodbye".

These meetings can awkwardly continue for another half an hour at times as people ramble and chat about their day. Every once in a while one brave soul will attempt to put a bullet in the head of the meeting with something like

> OK so then I'll go and work on that report...

Where you might get a response that inspires hope of an escape

> Yes that sounds great...

Only to be met with a counter attack as they instead continue to string the rest of us along

> ...and I think there's a lot of value to creating another diagram in the report. You know, I think diagrams really help with....

## The <span class='meeting-type'>"It'll be recorded"</span> meeting

> The meeting that everyone agrees should be recorded. (Obviously this recording is never watched.)

A relatively self explanatory meeting that I feel many of us have experienced heavily with the recent uprise of remote working. You might have the wrong people in the room. You might all have other more important things to do. You might all feel exhausted. You might not have prepared effectively for the meeting.

It doesn't matter. It'll be recorded. All problems are solved as the idle, useless comments of the wrong group of people is digitally documented for the rest of human history to ignore in the hopes that one day, somewhere, somehow the right people will watch it and find some value.

They never do.

## The <span class='meeting-type'>awkward silence</span> meeting

> The meeting where most people are checking their f****** email instead of participating

In my humble opinion, the pandemic has increased the percentage of these meetings from 15% to approximately 90%.

This is the meeting where you look around at a series of muted black boxes with little white names in them. You speak for 15 minutes about a problem, and then say "So given the situation, what do people think about increasing the budget to resolve this issue?"

And then in response, someone says _________.

Eventually another person pipes in saying _________.

After 30 incredibly awkward seconds you generate some noise on your speakers to ensure your audio is working correctly. Everyones microphone can't be broken at the same time, can it? Is it a connection problem?

Unfortunately, it's not. You're just speaking to a group of 10 people checking facebook, their E-Mail, pictures of [things fitting perfectly into other things](https://thingsfittingperfectlyintothings.tumblr.com/), or daydreaming about having super powers.

## The <span class='meeting-type'>"that was a good discussion..."</span> meeting

> The meeting where a group speaks for over an hour about random work related topics accomplishing exactly nothing

This is where you plan a 20 minute meeting to figure out what software library to use to parse URL's and 75 min later you’re still discussing some irrelevant vulnerability you read about in a blog post last week.

Needless to say, at end have no idea what to actually do about the selection, and because we're part of a polite society no one wants to say "well, that was a complete waste of time" so instead they say "That was a good discussion. I think we learned a lot there, let’s schedule another meeting..."

Thus wasting everyone's time twice.

Speaking of scheduling another meeting...

## The <span class='meeting-type'>meeting about the previous meeting that was about the other meeting</span> meeting

> Sometimes a single meeting produces dozens of spawn that run around consuming all available resources resulting in complete destruction. In this way, meetings are like COVID.

Meetings are like a virus - a single virus not only kills a cell, but makes zombie cells (industry term, sorry for the jargon) that then create more of the birus to destroy more healthy cells and so on.

Similarly, from single source meeting, one can observe the spawning of dozens of zombie meetings which go off and waste hundreds or thousands of hours throughout an organization.

Take for example this flow:

1. You schedule a 20 minute meeting to decide on a company logo
2. People are unprepared and ask lots of irrelevant questions to hide the fact they have no idea what's going on
3. After an hour nothing useful has happened. You are waiting on a design from Bob to make a decision.
4. You invite everyone, including Bob, and schedule another meeting.
5. That second meeting is also missing Jamie the woman who OK's company colors. She is equally critical - just in a slightly different way.

And so on. There could be dozens before people finally lose interest and stop wasting time. Lucy eventually picks the logo out of frustration and the customers barely even notice.

People hate these meetings. They don’t want to talk about it anymore.

That brings me to the next meeting...

## The <span class='meeting-type'>great escape</span> meeting

> The recurring meeting everyone constantly tries to avoid

This is the (often recurring) meeting that no one wants to go to - but everyone still thinks it’s probably a good idea, so no one suggests it doesn't get scheduled anymore.

Where else would you have time to daydream about that hot single looking person you saw in the coffee shop, after all?

This is the meeting you used to have to literally drag people across the floor rolling in their little office chairs to attend. It's the one you have to send a dozen messages to people about to force them to come. It's the one you constantly ask if it's necessary or not only to get the response "I think they're useful!". Mixed messages are hard.

## The <span class='meeting-type'>interrupted</span> meeting

> The meeting where someone is sneak attacked by their children or partner (or Amazon delivery)

Not the most horrible
When kids this is usually adorable
I’ve seen people leave full on presentations to go get new bluetooth headset
leaving everyone awkwardly waiting

## The <span class='meeting-type'>where is this meeting taking place?</span> meeting

> Hello? Where is everyone? Am I early?

There are dozens of channels, rooms, zoom ids - far too easy to get confused
Often after 10 minutes you leave and join another room, only to find at exact moment everyone has left to join the one you were in
teams vs zoom vs google hangouts
Team member has solved - start up a zoom call that just says

## The <span class='meeting-type'>let's get drunk</span> meeting

> This one isn't that bad

Makes a meeting a lot more interesting
Thought it deserved a spot on the list
Get people to reveal things they otherwise might not
Next meeting can also be fun....I call it the

## The <span class='meeting-type'>so, how are your kids?</span> meeting

> The meeting that’s taken up 30% by small talk while waiting for a few members who are late

Expect 10 people and 6 arrive on time, and you start the ‘grace period’
Then what do you do for the first 15 minutes while you wait?
Just chat - shoot the shit
Actually learn a lot about people this way - I quite like these meetings

## The <span class='meeting-type'>passive aggressive</span> meeting

> The meeting where you think you’ll discuss something useful, but actually someone just wants to complain about not being informed about something

Maybe some political grudge
Maybe some issue with a process
Maybe the caller of the meeting is actually upset they weren’t included in something
Main point: Most of this meeting isn’t about any useful topic, it’s about how someone is pissed off

## The <span class='meeting-type'>all or nothing</span> meeting

> The meeting that goes on for the fully scheduled 60 minutes when it’s actually complete in less than 15.

A meeting about ‘where are my keys’
About 6 minutes in everyone realizes they’re in your jacket pocket
But there’s 54 minutes left - unbounded potential
How could you waste all that time, where you could be talking?
So they start saying shit like "sure they might be in the jacket but first of all….really...what is a key" - "why do humans live in houses?"
54 minutes later discussing a nietzsche passage
Someone is like "Ohhh we’ve run over we’ll have to schedule another meeting"
