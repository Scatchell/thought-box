# Unbiased Search {#unbiased-search}

[https://unbiased-search.herokuapp.com/](https://unbiased-search.herokuapp.com/)

Unbiased search is a tool meant to help you to search for things in a fair, unbiased fashion so people can get the information they want, instead of skewed search results.

### The problem it solves

This experiment came from some discussions I had with friends/family members. People often had an explanation for why they believe a "fact" generating a conversation something along the lines of:

> Person 1: Wow, my computers personal assistant is incredibly useful!

> Person 2: Sure, but all of your conversations are being constantly monitored and shared across the internet.

> Person 1: Really? That sounds highly illegal, where did you hear about that?

> Person 2: Yea, it's all over Google! Look: **types into search engine "How the Government is recording all voice traffic from digital assistants and using it against us"**

The internet is a wonderful, beautiful place...but pretty much anything you type into a search engine will yield *some* results. The trick is trying to create a query where you are asking a general question, not trying to receive the answer you already expect.

I realize there are many other pieces to the puzzle here besides simply the way a query is phrased (i.e. a search bubble being created using cookies and user specific history, as just one example) but I thought this was quite common and am worried it has a detrimental impact on our society overall, potentially dividing us further and further away from moderate, informed, realistic, scientific views on controversial statements.

### How it works

[Unbiased search](https://unbiased-search.herokuapp.com/) is a website built to try and use some [natural language processing (NLP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) to gauge whether a search query is written in a biased way...

> How the Government is recording all voice traffic from digital assistants and using it against us

Or an unbiased way...

> Is the Government capable of monitoring voice traffic from digital assistants?

The website takes any query and gives its best guess suggestion on whether it is biased or not, warning the user not to search in the case of a highly biased search.

# What is COVID-19? {#what-is-covid-19}

[https://www.what-is-covid.com/](https://www.what-is-covid.com/) 

"What is COVID" is a website built to try and expose easily consumable, research backed information about the COVID-19 disease and the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes it.

It uses three different categories of answers to expose information starting in a very simple and consumable way, and getting more detailed and scientific.

### The problem is solves

Public interest in COVID-19 is exploding, and as seems to be the norm these days, this unleashes a black hole of misinformation about the topic across the internet. This not only can confuse people who consume information that is not backed by any legitimate data by leading them to believe in ridiculous claims, but it is doubly injurious to our minds because it can also make us start to lack trust in more legitimately thought out and scientifically backed sources. When people aren't looking at what research logically justifies an argument, there is no difference between the random statements and the painstakingly well-thought-out arguments, meaning people might start to mistrust both sources equally.

A big part of this problem seemed to be that people have two possible sources of information about COVID-19:

1. A random, unbacked tweet or opinion post which it is very difficult to understand the truth value of
2. A well backed scientific paper that is almost impenetrable to the average reader

What is COVID-19 is an attempt to find a middle grounds between these two by offering different levels of depth to the answer to common COVID questions. A reader can just glance at the quick and simple answer, but if they are interested to learn more details and see what research backs the statement, they can expand the answer further and read a "Detailed" answer or a "Scientific" answer.
