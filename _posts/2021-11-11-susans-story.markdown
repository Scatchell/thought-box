Meet Suzy. She's the tech lead of a team. She wants to do the "right" thing, but also wants to do it in a way that everyone gets on board with. This is often a difficult task. Suzy's main goal comes almost out of obsession, she wants to make things easier to do. She wants to make the code easier to write, and easier to deliver.

Meet Jamie, Jamie is a leader in the same organization. She designs 

Jamie and Bob are both leaders in the organization. They have been jockying for a "director of technology" position for a long time now. Jamie and Bob make the decisions. They decide whether or not the company focuses on developing their hardward devices, or their software offerings. They decie whether budget goes to marketing, or IT. They decide whether the company spends money on an agile transition, or not. They have all the power.

Bob is currently tech director, and decides it's best to focus on a video chat service and advertise mostly on social media given the environment and current market research. As soon as he speaks, everything changes. There is a reorganization, new people are hired and long time employees are fired, the marketting messages change and the entire development cycle shifts toward this goal.

However, as it turns out, the system and processes that drive it are so old and slow that in the end, nothing happens. Bob is eventually removed from his position, as nothing special happened during his role there and the company continued to lose money.

In the meantime, Suzy carefully advances her relationships, making sure not to burn any bridges. She studies the technologies that would be useful to her teams, and fosters the growth of her team members. She just works with one small team of 8 people, but she does the best that she can. They start to develop new tools and processes which are very successful for the team. Some people see what's happening and start to ask if they can copy any of the techniques from the team. Suzy is more than happen to help, and gives as much as she can, expecting nothing in particular in return. More teams start to copy these new strategies and they start to use the tools created by Suzy's team. Eventually, a shared services team is created to help manage some of them, and Suzy works closely with them to ensure these services are sheparded in the best way possible.

Meanwhile, Jamie fights hard to take the gap created by Bob being moved to another department. She's always wanted decision making power and thinks Bob went about things all wrong, and foolishly decided to focus on video chat and social media advertising. The real way forward, she knows with utter confidence, is to focus the tech sector more on user experience design and to advertise through more conventional methods like television and billboards. She sees a great future for the company if they would just listen to her.

Jamie finally convinces enough people her ideas are the way forward, and someone gives her a chance in the new tech director role. They need to fill the position anyways, and there are no other good candidates who have the required relationships and experience within the company. In a way, she's the only reasonable choice.

Jamie is now tech director, and decides it's best to focus on user experience design and advertise through television and billboard ads, given the environment and current market research. As soon as she speaks, everything changes. There is a reorganization, new people are hired and long time employees are fired, the marketing messages change and the entire development cycle shifts toward this goal.

Meanwhile, Suzy doesn't mind so much. Her goal is to fix the big process problems in the organization, and make things more efficient. She continues working with the platform team and decides to move forward with an experiment she's read about, a new way to distribute platform services more easily to teams. She tests it out, and after a few weeks it doesn't seem to work. She gets some flak for this failure, but she's already working on the new idea. Everyone trusts Suzy - they somehow feel she wants to fix things more than to achieve any recognition herself.

She tries another experiment, offering the services in a different way, using a different strategy and set of tools. This time, success is obvious after only a month. Many consumers start leveraging these platform services, she carefully tracks metrics to see that people are developing things more often and getting changes faster to customers. She works with the platform team to develop an A/B testing system based on some blog posts she read last month, trying a few strategies until she discovers one that works. Her platform makes it so easy to consume the metrics from the tests, and make changes based on the feedback, that it would be idiotic for any time not to take advantage. More teams start to come on board and the platform becomes a core part of the entire organizations IT strategy.

Jamie hears about this "platform" stuff a couple of times. She's mildly interested and tells people it's a good thing, and how things like that would never have happened under Bob's rule. When asked for an increase in the budget to expand the platform services more quickly, she tells them that unfortunately they are in the midst of a new marketing compaign which will make or break the new UX launch, and can't spare the money.

Suzy, of course, is annoyed when she finds out that the platform can't grow faster with a bigger budget, but she does her best with what she has, and doesn't make a fuss about it. She continues to do the best job that she can and when asked to be promoted within the organization, she turns them down, suggesting it would take her too far away from all the work she's driven up until that point, and that she doesn't want to lose the opportunity to write code and stay familiar with the relationships she's made in her sector. Everyone understands and they give her even more leeway - some people even flex their own budgets behind their superior's backs to help with Suzy's platform efforts, knowing that it will benefit their teams later on.

Jamie's marketting compaign costs a lot of money, and doesn't do that well. People are confused by the new UX changes and they are delivered much later, and at much lower quality than promised. After a few months, Jamie sees the writing on the wall and takes another job before the disaster becomes anymore obvious, leaving the organization with the tech director gap once again.

Alfred then jumps into action. He's always thought Jamie was going the wrong direction, and that if they invested instead in virtual reality and focused on tik-tok advertising, that the company could really prove they are behind new age technology and penetrate a totally new market. He fights hard for the tech director position and eventually convinces the right people that this is the way forward. They need to fill the position anyways, and there are no other good candidates who have the required relationships and experience within the company. In a way, he's the only reasonable choice.

Suzy's platform is now really gaining traction. Because of the great success, she's started to build a new culture in the organization. Before they were siloed and argumentative - but the platform has shown them if they collaborate they can benefit both themselves AND other parts of the organization at the same time. The culture of a zero sum game starts to dissapate, and a culture of partnership and alliance starts to be forged. All of this comes from the obvious benefits shown by a single team, which multiplied to 2, then to 10, and eventually become a culture that if not followed, other teams would be the laggards. It practically forced the organization into a state of culture change, altering the way leaders think instead of firing them and hiring others with "new skills".

In the meantime, Alfred is now tech director, and decides it's best to focus on VR and advertise mostly through tik-tok given the environment and current market research. As soon as he speaks, everything changes. There is a reorganization, new people are hired and long time employees are fired, the marketting messages change and the entire development cycle shifts toward this goal.

These changes disrupt Suzy's world slightly, but most of it has little to no effect, and she continues on without much fuss. Great things are happening within the organization due to the cultural shift that was made.

Alfred starts to develop the VR offerings, and though out of the three ideas of the last 3 tech directors (including Alfred) this one is by far the most complex and difficult to implement, Suzy's cultural changes have reached the knee of the curve and are becoming very obvious. Alfred finds that when he requests things to be done, they quickly get finished and deployed - communication is strong, and the shared services are used by any new teams that spin up. Sometimes new teams are spun up just to test ideas, because it is so easy to create them. If they fail, no one feels bad about it, because a culture of failing fast and learning from mistakes has been developed within the organization. Things are much different than when Jamie and Bob tried to develop their companies services.

After only 7 months, incredibly the teams release the first VR offering and start testing it with customers. Alfred thinks it's a bad idea and prefers to wait until they have a more "fully complete" product, but the cultural change in the organization is so significant at this point that his middle managers manage to convince him of the value of releasing small changes first to test with the customers. Eventually Alfred agrees, though he knows in the back of his mind it's going to be a failure, and exactly who to blame when it goes wrong.

To his delighted surprise, customers enjoy the new offerings. Even more so, they are blown away at how they can give direct feedback about the product and see those changes developed into the offering in mere weeks. They start to tell their friends about this new company that makes this amazing VR app. Some people see it on tik-tok, I'm sure....but that doesn't really matter much, does it?

Alfred rakes in the money and the respect. His powerful decision making prowess is what brought the company to this high point. They are well known around the industry and even cross industry within the VR sector for some of the amazing innovations the teams have made...er....I mean Alfred has made!

 Suzy can clearly see that the cultural shifts, platform offerings, continuous delivery, and more that she has driven have had an incredible impact. But she also knows that it wasn't just her, it was a series of teams around her that were amazing enough to actively listen and react to the thoughts and advice of others. For this reason, she never feels comfortable taking any credit for the changes, knowing they would have been impossible without all the other actors that were involved. Though she turned it down before, she feels she might be ready to be promoted now that she has seen all the success, thinking she could make even bigger beneficial impact with more control over the budgets, but she's never asked again. She's never even noticed again.

However, clever as ever, she takes advantage of the newfound money within the organization by asking for a larger budget for the platform. She believes they are in a mature enough state to start continuously deploying, and restructure a few big architectural shifts that will cost a lot of money in the next few months but would save incredibly on maintenance costs over the next 2 years.

Alfred is asked about this request at a meeting, but he has a lot of other things on his plate with the new tik-tok advertising compaign and a possible big decision to move into AR. He doesn't have time or budget to waste on these platform things. He quickly turns the request down and continues on with the other much more important decisions he has to make that day. Alfred is soon promoted to CTO and starts to make a name for himself in the industry. He buys his 3rd house and starts to plan a move to another company as CEO for a large salary increase. His successful resume from the VR program makes him a shoe-in.

Suzy is slightly annoyed that she doesn't get the budget, but she does the best that she can within the constraints of her organization. She continues to push for the changes she wanted and eventually convinces enough people to redirect their budgets and time to help her, knowing it will benefit them in the future. The AR releases are also a great success. Alfred gets a huge bonus from this.

A few people also thank Suzy for her help.
